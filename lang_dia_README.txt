What's this?
============

	These are extra languages and dialects for use with the World of Warcraft Lore AddOn.
	In each of the text files you find either ONE language or ONE dialect.
	Language files start with 'Lang', files containing a dialect start with 'Dia'.

How to use
==========

	If you want to start using a certain language or dialect in this language pack, you
	go through the following steps:

	1. Open the text file that contains the desired language or dialect.
	2. Select the ENTIRE text (make sure you don't miss the "};" marks in the end!)
	3. Copy this text to the clipboard (e.g. by using CTRL-INSERT or CTRL-C)
	4. Locate the Lore folder in your WoW interface/addons folder.
	5. Open the 'dialects.lua' file into a text editor (e.g. notepad.exe)
	6. Paste the text from the clipboard into the file (e.g. using SHIFT-INSERT or CTRL-V)
	7. Save the changes to the 'dialects.lua' file
	8. Start up World of Warcraft

Notes
=====

	* First of all, these languages are made by other players and I did NOT test them.
	* Nor do I promise they will work or that they will work well.
	* It is also a good idea to make a copy of your 'dialects.lua' file before you modify it,
	  so that you will have a backup if you made some mistake, or adding a language/dialect
	  messed up your 'dialects.lua' file.
